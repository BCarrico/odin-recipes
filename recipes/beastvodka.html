    <h2>What is it?!</h2>
    <p>
        This exotic vodka drink was fashioned to celebrate the Seattle Seahawks, 
        their team colors, and their awe-inspiring running back. Whether you're watching the game at home or 
        tailgating outside the stadium, this cocktail will help you get into Beast Mode and roar like a 
        real 12th Man! Give it a Beast Mode quake, serve over ice, or shake into your favorite vodka-based cocktail. 
        Garnish with a 12th Man flag!
